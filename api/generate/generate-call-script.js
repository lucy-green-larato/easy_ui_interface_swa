Using the sales pitch below, generate a cold call script that:

- Is written in formal, British business English
- Has no headings, no slang, and avoids all US-style phrasing (e.g. blocker, flex, roll out)
- Flows as a natural spoken conversation
- Begins by referencing observations from similar businesses, but makes no assumptions about the prospectâ€™s current situation
- Introduces the offer as a lightweight operational enhancement, not a rebuild
- Includes one specific, relevant customer example with measurable results
- Handles common objections factually and without pressure
- Ends with a confident, specific call to action using the following wording:
"${cta}"

Adjust the tone and style based on the following setting:

Tone: ${toneDescriptor}

If tone is "warm and professional":
- Use natural phrasing and a more conversational rhythm
- Soften transitions and remove overly formal connectors
- Prioritise clarity and rapport over technical density

If tone is "formal and corporate":
- Use precise, structured business language
- Maintain professional distance and clear articulation
- Avoid any casual phrasing or implied familiarity

Then write a short section titled:
**Sales tips for colleagues conducting similar calls**
Provide exactly 3 practical tips in a warm, instructional tone for less experienced colleagues.

Role being called: ${buyerType}

Sales pitch:
"""${pitch}"""
