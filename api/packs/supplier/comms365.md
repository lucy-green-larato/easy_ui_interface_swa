## 7. Competitive Context (High-Level)

> Keep this short; detailed competitor profiles live in industry or competitor packs.

* Named competitor: Large UK telcos and ISPs offering SD-WAN + 5G bundles

  * Type (e.g. telco, MSP, specialist, aggregator): Telco / ISP
  * Short comparison (1–2 sentences on where they are strong vs this supplier): Strong brand recognition, national scale and ability to bundle SD-WAN, mobile and fixed services; may compete on integrated portfolios and price but are less focused on rapid day-one connectivity and specialist Starlink integration.

* Named competitor: Connectivity-focused MSPs and site connectivity specialists

  * Type: MSP / specialist connectivity provider
  * Short comparison: Compete on rapid deployment and sector focus in areas such as construction and events; Comms365 differentiates through its own bonding platforms, enterprise Starlink control and resilience-first hybrid WAN designs.

* Named competitor: Traditional carriers and large network providers

  * Type: Carrier / network provider
  * Short comparison: Provide extensive fixed and mobile networks with broad service catalogues; Comms365 positions as a specialist alternative where time-to-connect, fixed-IP reachability and edge resilience are critical.
