## Quick checklist: how to size up a company in 90 seconds

### 1. Get a feel for who they are
Start with the people and the shape of the business before you look at numbers.  
Notice what has changed. A new director usually means a new agenda. Someone leaving can point to internal pressure or restructuring.  
A long-standing team often signals steady leadership.  
A change of address or company name can mark expansion, consolidation or a rebrand.  
These clues tell you how the business is behaving and where it might be heading.

### 2. Look at turnover
Turnover is total sales.  
If it’s rising, the company is growing. They may be investing, scaling or modernising systems.  
If it’s flat or falling, they may be cautious. Focus your thinking on efficiency, automation or cost reduction.  
You’re not looking for precision here, just direction.

### 3. Check profit
Profit shows how much is left once costs are covered.  
Rising profit suggests control and confidence.  
Falling profit suggests margin pressure or investment in growth.  
This helps you decide whether to frame your offer around ambition or stability.

### 4. Look at cash
Cash tells you how easily they can pay and how strong their confidence is.  
Plenty of cash means freedom to choose and room to invest.  
Tight cash means decisions will be slower and risk-based.  
If cash is low but turnover is up, they may be expanding quickly. That can be an ideal time to talk about control and planning tools.

### 5. Glance at assets and debts
You only need the rough balance.  
If assets are higher than debts, they are on firm ground.  
If debts outweigh assets, they may be stretched or relying on finance.  
This shapes how you position your offer and payment structure.

### 6. Watch the trend
Look across at least three years if you can.  
Consistent growth shows confidence.  
Fluctuation suggests project-based work or market pressure.  
A sudden change needs context. Read the directors’ notes if you want clues about why.

### 7. Write a one-line summary
When you finish, capture the story in a single line.  
For example:  
*£10 million turnover. Steady growth. Cash improving. Confident and ready to invest.*  
That sentence becomes your shortcut when planning outreach or segmentation.

### 8. Keep the mindset right
You are not auditing. You are reading behaviour.  
The numbers show momentum, confidence and change.  
Once you can see those patterns, you’ll start to recognise opportunity before anyone else does.
