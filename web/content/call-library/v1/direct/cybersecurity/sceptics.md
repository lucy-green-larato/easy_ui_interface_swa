# Cybersecurity: Sceptics
### 1. Opening: Understanding Your Business Needs
You are not in the business of buying problems. Your systems work, your clients are happy and nothing major has gone wrong. But times have changed. Insurers now want proof of security basics. Clients ask what happens if their data is compromised. Even banks are asking more questions before approving funding. You do not need buzzwords or complexity. You just need confidence that the business is protected, documented and prepared.
### 2. Buyer Pain: Cost and Productivity Concerns
Most firms in your position are not reckless. They are just focused elsewhere. But gaps build up quietly:
No password policy, or one no one remembers
Files backed up to local devices but not the cloud
Staff clicking links without knowing the risks
Insurer queries that are hard to answer confidently
The cost of a breach is not just IT downtime. It is lost orders, increased premiums and a long tail of admin. Forty-three per cent of UK buyers report cost pressure, and thirty-two per cent cite performance shortfalls as blockers. The best time to act is before it becomes urgent.
### 3. Buyer Desire: Aligning with Business Goals
Sceptical buyers want security that:
Requires no technical expertise to manage
Runs in the background with simple reporting
Meets the basics insurers and clients now expect
Avoids disruption to existing systems or staff
You want cover, not a rebuild. You want clarity, not jargon. And above all, you want this sorted quickly and sensibly.
### 4. Example Illustration: From Problem to Solution
A 25-person architecture firm had never had a cyber issue. But a new client requested their policy before contract signing. Their broker also warned that without action, premiums could double. We performed a cyber essentials check-up and installed managed antivirus, offsite backups and secure password vaulting. Nothing flashy. Just proven basics done well.
In the first quarter:
Their insurer froze premiums for 12 months
They secured a £200,000 contract after clearing procurement checks
Staff stopped reusing passwords after training and password manager rollout
The business created a simple, board-approved security policy
Security moved from invisible to handled. No drama. No disruption.
### 5. Handling Objections
“This sounds expensive.”
We start with a fixed-price check-up. Most fixes are low-cost or already included in what you pay for but don’t use.
“We’ve never had an issue.”
That is exactly why now is the time to act. Planned fixes cost less than emergency call-outs.
“Our team isn’t technical.”
They don’t need to be. We handle the setup, and they just follow a few simple steps if something goes wrong.
### 6. Call to Action: Next Steps
Let’s book a 30-minute Cyber Check-Up. You will receive:
A red, amber, green snapshot of your current risks
A short plan to bring you up to insurer and client expectations
A starter pack with policy templates and board-ready guidance
I will also send our “Cyber Basics for Growing Firms” guide so you can handle future questions with confidence. Would Thursday or Friday morning work best?
