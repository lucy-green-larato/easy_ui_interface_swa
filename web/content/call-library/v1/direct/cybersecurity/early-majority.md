# Cybersecurity: Early Majority
### 1. Opening: Understanding Your Business Needs
You are not starting from scratch. You may already have endpoint protection, a security-aware IT lead and a few policies in place. But things have changed. Auditors are asking tougher questions. Insurers want to see evidence of controls. Clients want proof you can be trusted with sensitive data. Cybersecurity is no longer just “good housekeeping”. It is essential to securing deals, defending margins and protecting your reputation.
### 2. Buyer Pain: Cost and Productivity Concerns
You are doing your best to cover the bases. But gaps, noise and inefficiency still creep in:
Staff reuse passwords or send data insecurely despite training
Monthly reports are stitched together manually
One false alert wastes hours and drains confidence in the system
Cloud sprawl makes it hard to track where data lives
37% of UK buyers say cost is holding them back, while thirty-two per cent cite performance issues that block progress. You want security that protects the business without slowing it down.
### 3. Buyer Desire: Aligning with Business Goals
What early majority buyers really want is peace of mind. That means:
One clear view of threats and vulnerabilities across devices, apps and cloud
Alerts that highlight real issues, not background noise
Policies that apply automatically, no matter where people work
The ability to prove good security practices to clients, boards or insurers
Security should run in the background. Quietly effective. Always on.
### 4. Example Illustration: From Problem to Solution
A 90-person digital agency had security controls in place but no consistent way to show it. Their clients were increasingly requesting due diligence evidence, and their insurer wanted documentation before renewing. Staff were overwhelmed by alerts, and finance had no idea what tools were delivering value.
We started with a Cyber Health Audit, then deployed an integrated security dashboard that pulled signals from existing tools. We introduced automated reporting and created a tiered policy model that applied by role and geography.
Within six weeks:
Time spent on monthly reports fell by 75 per cent
Premiums were held flat instead of increasing
The business secured two new contracts thanks to improved due diligence evidence
Staff confidence rose after removing alert fatigue and false positives
Security became visible, useful and respected across the business.
### 5. Handling Objections
We’ve already got something in place.”
Perfect. We help you make the most of that investment by removing gaps, overlaps and manual work.
“We don’t have specialist skills.”
You don’t need them. We handle design and deployment, and your team just uses the outputs.
“Won’t this be disruptive?”
We roll out in stages. You get live data and results before you commit to full change.
### 6. Call to Action: Next Steps
Let’s book a 45-minute Cyber Health Check. You will get:
A visual report showing gaps, overlaps and key risks
A map of your current security signals across cloud, device and identity
A three-step plan to reduce workload without adding risk
I will also include our “Security Reporting Toolkit” with templates for board, insurer and client use. Would Tuesday or Wednesday work best?
