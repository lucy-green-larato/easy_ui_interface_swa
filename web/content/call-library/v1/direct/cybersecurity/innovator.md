# Cybersecurity: Innovators
### 1. Opening: Understanding Your Business Needs
You already treat cybersecurity as a revenue enabler, not a compliance task. You are launching new customer services, handling sensitive data at scale and absorbing acquisitions at pace. The risk is not just a breach. It is delayed go-to-market, board concern or regulator flags that block investment. You need cybersecurity that moves as fast as you do, without becoming a bottleneck.
### 2. Buyer Pain: Cost and Productivity Concerns
Fast-growing firms often build patchwork security over time. You layer controls for each market, product or partner. Eventually, you have three EDR tools, five portals and 200 alerts a day. Meanwhile, the board asks for assurance, and your security team is firefighting instead of enabling. Thirty-seven per cent of UK tech buyers cite cost as a blocker, and thirty-two per cent say performance gaps stop progress. The cost of inaction is compound exposure. And missed opportunity.
### 3. Buyer Desire: Aligning with Business Goals
You want cybersecurity to:
Move at the speed of product and GTM
Give a unified view of threats, compliance and risk
Enable secure remote access and data handling by default
Prove value to execs and regulators without manual effort
That means a platform approach that can flex across departments, cloud environments and regions without repeating work or requiring every team to become security experts.
### 4. Example Illustration: From Problem to Solution
A 120-person SaaS vendor had scaled quickly across the UK and DACH. Its stack included three SIEM tools, four endpoint agents and a homegrown VPN. Growth was strong. But audits were slow, onboarding was brittle and staff had lost confidence in incident alerts. We ran a two-week maturity audit, then replaced four tools with a single extended detection and response platform. We built out automated evidence gathering for ISO 27001 and enabled context-aware access policies across cloud apps. Result:
Compliance reporting time dropped by 68 per cent
Incident alerts fell from 190 to 22 per day, with false positives below 2 per cent
M&A risk posture was clear enough to accelerate investor due diligence
Security went from red flag to green light. Without slowing product.
### 5. Handling Objections
“We’ve already spent a lot.”
That spend is not wasted. We build on your estate and identify redundant tools that can be retired.
“This will slow us down.”
We prove impact in one business unit first. The playbook is yours whether or not you roll out further.
“Our team is small.”
Exactly why automation, integration and default policy matter. Security becomes built-in, not bolted on.
### 6. Call to Action: Next Steps
Let’s run a 45-minute Cybersecurity Health Check. You’ll get:
A threat and maturity snapshot benchmarked against peers
A list of quick wins that reduce attack surface this quarter
A roadmap for proving value to the board
I’ll also send our “Board Reporting for Cybersecurity Leaders” guide, designed to help CISOs secure buy-in for smart investments. Does Tuesday or Thursday suit best?
