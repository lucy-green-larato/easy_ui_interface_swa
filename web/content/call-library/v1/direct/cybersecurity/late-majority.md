# Cybersecurity: Late Majority
### 1. Opening: Understanding Your Business Needs
You are not looking for bells and whistles. You want to protect the business, satisfy insurance criteria and avoid disruption. If a cyber issue hit, could you prove to the board, insurer or customer that you had the right controls in place? That question is coming up more often, especially in audits, tenders and renewals. Quiet, reliable cybersecurity is no longer optional. It is part of staying open for business.
### 2. Buyer Pain: Cost and Productivity Concerns
Late majority firms often face problems that go unnoticed until something breaks:
Passwords written on post-it notes or shared across teams
No recovery plan if email or files are locked out
Security alerts no one knows how to respond to
Insurers asking for documentation the business cannot provide
These risks build over time. Forty-three per cent of buyers report cost pressure, and thirty-two per cent say performance gaps are holding them back. That is not about fear. It is about protecting cash flow, reputation and day-to-day operations.
### 3. Buyer Desire: Aligning with Business Goals
You want cybersecurity to be:
Simple to use with minimal staff training
Easy to report on for insurers and customers
Built into the way you already work
Backed by support, not left to internal IT
The goal is basic protection that works. Quietly, reliably and without drama.
### 4. Example Illustration: From Problem to Solution
A wholesale distributor with 60 staff had grown steadily over ten years. But they were increasingly getting questions from customers about data security. Their insurer had issued a warning after spotting no password policy or recovery plan. Staff were nervous about what would happen if email went down. We ran a one-day audit and implemented a simple cyber hygiene package with password management, multi-factor authentication and automated backups.
Within the first month:
The insurer lifted their warning and froze premiums
Customers were reassured by new policies and response plans
The team had a clear playbook for any incident
Downtime from phishing links dropped after training and controls were added
There was no major overhaul. Just a few key changes that reduced risk and showed the business was in control.
### 5. Handling Objections
“We’ve never had a problem.”
That is great. The goal is to keep it that way, with minimal effort and no emergency call-outs.
“We don’t have the time.”
We run the audit and design the plan. Most of the work happens outside your business hours.
“This stuff is too technical.”
We handle the setup. Your team just sees clear results and one place to go for help.

Let’s run a 30-minute Cyber Risk Review. You will get:
A checklist of red, amber and green risks
A list of simple fixes based on what peers are doing
A starter pack for your insurer, client or board
I will also send our “Cyber Essentials Guide for Busy Teams”, showing how to meet expectations without disruption. Does Wednesday morning or Thursday afternoon work better?
