# Technical Services: Late Majority
### 1. Opening: Understanding Your Business Needs
You have systems in place. They mostly do what’s needed. But small issues are starting to build up. New hires struggle to get access. Key data lives in people’s heads or on spreadsheets. Reports are slow, and integrations are fragile.
You are not looking for a complete overhaul. You are looking for help that is practical, specific and proven to work. Something that supports your team without requiring major changes or ongoing complexity.
We work with businesses like yours every day. They want to improve how technology supports operations but need help doing it in a way that feels manageable.
### 2. Buyer Pain: Cost and Productivity Concerns
Most firms in this stage tell us they are worried about spending time and money on the wrong thing. They have tried hiring someone who left after six months, or brought in a partner who created more work than they solved.
There is also a fear that any change will break what is already working, or that their systems are too old or too custom to support modern tooling.
In our recent survey, 48 per cent of late majority buyers said they had delayed upgrades because they were unsure how to manage the change without disruption. That kind of uncertainty leads to missed opportunities and growing frustration from staff and customers.
### 3. Buyer Desire: Aligning with Business Goals
The ideal support looks like this:
A clear, scoped piece of work that fixes a known issue
No surprises, jargon or unproven tools
Help that is easy to understand, with no long learning curve
Step-by-step progress that keeps your existing systems running
Someone you can trust to flag risks and explain options
We start small. That might mean stabilising a key integration, improving reporting, or preparing for a system upgrade. Everything is designed to reduce risk, not add it.
### 4. Example Illustration: From Problem to Solution
A family-owned logistics company came to us after they experienced three reporting failures in a single month. Their warehouse management system had been heavily customised over the years and was becoming unreliable. Every time something changed, it affected reports used by finance and customer service.
We did a short discovery review to map how the data flowed and where problems were most likely to occur. Then we introduced a lightweight reporting layer that pulled clean data without needing changes to the core system.
This gave them consistent, accurate reports without touching the parts of the system they were worried about. Over the next two months, internal support requests dropped by 40 per cent and staff spent less time fixing export errors and chasing numbers.
### 5. Handling Objections
“We don’t have the time to get into this.”
That’s exactly why we keep it simple. You tell us the problem, we come back with a practical plan. No long meetings or confusing proposals.
“We’re not sure what the real issue is.”
That’s normal. Our first job is usually helping you get clarity. We run light discovery sessions that help separate the symptoms from the cause.
“Our systems are too old to fix.”
They might be. But often, a small change around the edges can buy you time, improve stability and reduce support pain. We work with what you have, not what you wish you had.
### 6. Call to Action: Next Steps
Let’s keep it straightforward. We offer a 30-minute review call to understand the issue you’re dealing with and suggest a low-risk next step.
I can also share a short guide called “Fix What’s Breaking First”, which includes checklists, example outcomes and tips for working with limited internal IT. Would that be useful to your ops or IT lead this week?
