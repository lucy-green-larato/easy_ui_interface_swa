# Technical Services: Sceptics
### 1. Opening: Understanding Your Business Needs
You know your business inside out. You’ve built systems that work the way you want. People know what they’re doing and when. It might not be pretty, but it gets the job done.
You’ve probably heard pitches for new platforms, new ways of working or shiny solutions that promise to transform everything. But you’re not convinced. You want facts, not buzzwords. You’re open to improvements if they’re practical, not if they disrupt what’s already running.
That’s exactly where we come in. No assumptions, no generic plans. Just a sensible look at where technical support might make things run better.
### 2. Buyer Pain: Cost and Productivity Concerns
The biggest frustration sceptics share with us is wasted time. Time spent chasing answers. Time lost when a supplier hands something over that doesn’t work properly. Time fixing small issues that keep cropping up, even though the systems are supposed to be stable.
You’re not looking to throw money at a problem. You’re trying to avoid bigger issues by getting the right help in a targeted way.
In our survey, 46 per cent of firms in this category said they had experienced hidden costs from projects that didn’t have enough technical oversight. That includes delays, missed requirements and integrations that needed rework.
### 3. Buyer Desire: Aligning with Business Goals
You’re not asking for miracles. You want:
Problems solved, not pushed back to your team
Support that fits your systems, not the other way around
A clear scope, with known outcomes and no jargon
Someone who can explain what needs doing in plain language
Work that’s done properly, so you don’t have to fix it later
We only offer services where we can deliver real value. If something doesn’t make sense for your business, we’ll say so.
### 4. Example Illustration: From Problem to Solution
We worked with a regional construction firm that was struggling to extract consistent reports from their finance and project systems. Their internal team had created workarounds, but the process was manual, inconsistent and relied on two staff members who were about to retire.
They didn’t want a new system. They just wanted reporting to be easier.
We scoped a simple project to build a secure, automated data extract. No major changes to their software. No training required. Just clean data in the format they needed.
Within a few weeks, reporting errors dropped, finance saved time on reconciliations and project leads got updates faster. The internal team now has a clear handover process that doesn’t rely on individual knowledge.
### 5. Handling Objections
“We don’t need outside help.”
That’s fine. But if something’s taking longer than it should or causing frustration, it might be worth a quick chat. We only suggest solutions where we can make a real impact.
“Our systems are too specific.”
That’s true of many firms we work with. We don’t force new tools. We work with what’s already there, using methods that make sense for your environment.
“We’ve had bad experiences before.”
So have plenty of others. That’s why we keep things tight. Clear scope, defined outcomes, no waffle. You stay in control of every step.
### 6. Call to Action: Next Steps
Let’s keep it low pressure. We offer a free 30-minute consultation where you can raise a technical frustration or gap, and we’ll tell you honestly whether it’s worth fixing ,  and how.
I can also send over a one-page checklist showing common areas where similar businesses have saved time, reduced errors or gained visibility without major disruption. Would that be helpful this week?
