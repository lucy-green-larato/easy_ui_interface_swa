# Telecommunications: Innovators
### 1. Opening: Understanding Your Business Needs
You are not shopping for “telecoms” in the traditional sense. You are looking for programmable infrastructure that lets your business seize new revenue faster than your competitors. When a launch window opens or an investor asks how quickly you can scale into Germany, the network needs to answer “immediately”. That means softwaredefined control at the edge, cloud pathways you can spin up in minutes and the analytics to prove every pound spent is driving growth.
### 2. Buyer Pain: Cost and Productivity Concerns
The ambition is clear, yet most highgrowth firms still wrestle with legacy constraints. Fixed circuits that take six weeks to change, carrier SLAs that hide penalties and a patchwork of invoices nobody can reconcile. Fortyfour per cent of UK tech buyers say rising costs are already squeezing their initiatives, while fortyfive per cent put “improving operational efficiency” in their top priorities. When bandwidth upgrades require emails, POs and manual provisioning, those costs multiply. Downtime, latency spikes and shadow IT are the silent tax on innovation.
### 3. Buyer Desire: Aligning with Business Goals
Innovators want a network that behaves like modern software: elastic, observable and secure by design. The wishlist looks like this:
Pushbutton bandwidth for product launches or seasonal peaks
A single orchestration layer that covers fixed, mobile and cloud onramps
Builtin zerotrust controls so compliance never slows expansion
Realtime telemetry that feeds your BI stack, not a separate portal
When connectivity becomes that fluid, your GTM teams can experiment without begging IT for exceptions, and the board sees a direct line from spend to new revenue.
### 4. Example Illustration: From Problem to Solution
Take a fintech we supported last year. They were about to open offices in Warsaw and Dublin while piloting an AIdriven customerservice product. Their fourprovider MPLS mesh was holding them hostage: 90day change windows, opaque pricing and no unified view of performance. We designed an overlay SDWAN with integrated SASE, delivered on a single contract with usagebased billing. Latency between regions dropped thirtyseven per cent within the first month, remote site rollouts fell from nine weeks to ten days and dev teams began shipping features weekly instead of fortnightly. Finance finally had one invoice that mapped costs to business units, and the COO could show investors a network ready for any market they entered next.
### 5. Handling Objections
“We already have a network in place.”
That is your starting platform. We layer visibility and automation over it, then retire what no longer adds value. No forced ripandreplace.
“This looks like a massive project.”
We begin with a zerorisk proof of concept on two sites. You see live performance data before broader change is approved.
“Our requirements are unique.”
Precisely why a modular, softwaredefined approach works. Every policy, security stack and commercial term is mapped to your specific growth plan.
### 6. Call to Action: Next Steps
Let us schedule a fortyfiveminute discovery workshop with your product and IT leads. We will pinpoint where the current network constrains revenue and sketch a pilot that proves value inside one quarter. I will also send our Telecoms Simplification Guide, featuring case studies and a savings calculator, so you can start building the internal business case straight away. Which date next week suits your team?
