# Telecommunications: Sceptics
### 1. Opening: Understanding Your Business Needs
You do not waste money on unnecessary upgrades. Phones ring, invoices are paid, and clients stay happy. But external expectations have changed. Insurers, auditors and even existing customers now want evidence that your systems are secure, logged and resilient. If you cannot provide it, you risk premium hikes or lost contracts, even if nothing has ever gone wrong. Quietly modernising gives you the peace of mind to keep focusing on your clients.
### 2. Buyer Pain: Cost and Productivity Concerns
You are not chasing shiny features. But legacy phone systems create silent problems that build up over time:
Support teams miss voicemail because it is stuck on a physical handset
No audit trail for missed calls, causing tension with clients
Monthly bills creep up as providers remove legacy discounts
Cyber insurers request security features your system cannot deliver
These issues may not be urgent today, but they can cost money and reputation tomorrow. Forty-three per cent of UK buyers face cost pressure, and thirty-two per cent report performance gaps.
### 3. Buyer Desire: Aligning with Business Goals
Sceptical buyers want to solve real problems with as little disruption as possible. The right solution should:
Retain existing numbers, extensions and handsets where possible
Reduce costs without complex new training or staff pushback
Provide clear call logging and voicemail-to-email for traceability
Include basic security like encryption and password policies to meet insurance and compliance standards
The goal is not to transform telecoms into a strategic asset. It is to remove risk and hassle quietly.
### 4. Example Illustration: From Problem to Solution
A 22-person accountancy firm was running analogue lines with a ten-year-old PBX. They lost a long-standing client after a voicemail was missed over a weekend. Their insurer had flagged the lack of logging and access control. We carried out a half-day audit and replaced the system with a like-for-like cloud solution that mirrored existing extension numbers. We enabled voicemail-to-email and soft-phones for home workers, all with zero downtime.
In the first month:
Missed calls fell by 78 per cent
Annual spend dropped by £6,300 through cancellation of unused lines
Staff rated voicemail-to-email the “biggest time saver”
The insurer froze premiums and removed the compliance red flag
No new features. No big launch. Just risk removed, and time given back to the team.
### 5. Handling Objections
“We’re too small for this to matter.”
That is exactly why basic protection matters. Small firms are the easiest PBX targets. One compromise can cost more than the system upgrade.
“We’ve had no issues.”
Now is the time to act. Planned transitions avoid disruption and cost less than emergency workarounds.
There’s no appetite for change.”
We mirror your existing setup and run both systems in parallel until you approve a full switch. Staff won’t even notice it has changed.
