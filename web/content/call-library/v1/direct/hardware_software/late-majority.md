# Hardware & Software: Late Majority
### 1. Opening: Understanding Your Business Needs
You are not trying to chase trends. You want to keep the business running smoothly, avoid IT issues and make sure staff have what they need. If something breaks, it needs fixing. If the insurer asks about systems, you need to show you are in control. Hardware and software should be reliable, simple to manage and cost-effective. It should not be the thing that creates more work.
### 2. Buyer Pain: Cost and Productivity Concerns
As the business grows, technology gets harder to manage. You may be dealing with:
Old devices running slowly or becoming security risks
Licences renewed automatically with no review
Staff struggling with multiple logins or inconsistent tools Tool sprawl is increasingly cited as a blocker.
Delays when equipment fails or new starters need setting up
These things seem small until they pile up. Forty-three per cent of UK buyers say cost pressure is slowing their progress. 32% cite performance issues that block growth. What worked fine at 20 staff can become chaos at 80.
### 3. Buyer Desire: Aligning with Business Goals
You want IT to be simple and dependable. That means:
One clear view of devices and licences across the business
Support you can reach when something goes wrong
Software that does what it says without constant updates or training
A buying process that works at your pace, not someone else’s
The goal is to protect the business without adding admin or disruption.
### 4. Example Illustration: From Problem to Solution
A regional construction firm with 90 staff was spending more on IT every year but still getting complaints from users. Devices were out of sync, support was slow, and nobody could say what tools were in use. We ran a Tech Health Check and introduced a basic device and licence tracker tied to their onboarding process. We also replaced two software tools with a single platform that was easier for staff to use.
Within one quarter:
Helpdesk tickets dropped by 42 per cent
Time to set up a new user fell from five days to one
Licence spend reduced by 18 per cent
The business finally had one number to call for support
The team got the tools they needed. IT stopped being a blocker.
### 5. Handling Objections
“We don’t have an IT department.”
That is fine. We take care of setup and support. You get clear outcomes, not extra work.
“We’ve never had a proper inventory.”
That is where we start. One quick audit gives you visibility and confidence.
“Our staff aren’t tech-savvy.”
They do not need to be. We choose tools that work for real people, not just IT professionals.
### 6. Call to Action: Next Steps
Let’s book a 30-minute Tech Health Check. You will get:
A simple report showing where money is being wasted
A short list of actions to reduce risk and improve reliability
A checklist you can share with your insurer or accountant
I will also send our “Back-to-Basics Tech Toolkit”, which includes templates for onboarding, inventory and support. Would Thursday morning or Friday afternoon work better?
