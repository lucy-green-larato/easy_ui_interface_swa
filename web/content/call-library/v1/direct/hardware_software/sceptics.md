# Hardware & Software: Sceptics
### 1. Opening: Understanding Your Business Needs
You are not looking for new tech. You want things to work, staff to be productive and costs to stay under control. You have probably had bad experiences with over-promised systems in the past. But as the business grows, the old ways become harder to manage. Hardware and software do not have to be complicated, expensive or disruptive. They just need to support the business quietly and reliably.
### 2. Buyer Pain: Cost and Productivity Concerns
Many sceptical buyers know they have issues, but feel it is easier to leave things as they are. Common symptoms include:
Devices running slowly, crashing or needing frequent repairs
No single place to see who has what
Renewals paid automatically for software no one uses
Staff frustrated by clunky logins or missing tools
These issues cost time, money and morale. Forty-three per cent of buyers say cost pressure is squeezing their choices. 32% cite underperforming systems as a blocker to growth. Doing nothing often costs more than fixing it.
### 3. Buyer Desire: Aligning with Business Goals
You want the basics sorted. That means:
Devices that work and are easy to replace if needed
Licences that match what staff actually use
Simple tools with real support, not a maze of logins and jargon
A way to explain to insurers, boards or auditors that you are in control
You do not need complexity. You need visibility, simplicity and confidence.
### 4. Example Illustration: From Problem to Solution
A 40-person print firm was running everything through a mix of old desktops, shared logins and expired software. Their insurer flagged the lack of tracking, and onboarding a new starter took over a week. We did a quick audit and helped them put in place a small set of standardised laptops, a licence tracker and a single point of support.
Results in the first month:
Support calls dropped by 50 per cent
New starters were up and running within 48 hours
Licence waste cut by 22 per cent
The insurer approved the policy renewal without further queries
No flashy upgrades. Just a few sensible changes that made the business easier to run.
### 5. Handling Objections
“We’ve never had a major problem.”
That is the best time to act. Fixes are cheaper and easier before something breaks.
“We can’t afford another big project.”
This is not a big project. We fix the basics with low-cost steps and no internal disruption.
“Our staff won’t like change.”
We keep what works and only replace what is causing issues. Most staff are relieved, not resistant.
### 6. Call to Action: Next Steps
Let’s book a 30-minute Tech Basics Check. You will get:
A one-page summary of where small changes could save time and money
A plan to improve visibility across devices and software
A checklist that helps with insurance, audits or board reporting
I will also send our “No-Nonsense Tech Starter Kit”, including templates for inventory, renewals and support. Would Tuesday morning or Thursday afternoon work best?
