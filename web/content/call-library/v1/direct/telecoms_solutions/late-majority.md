# Telecommunications: Late Majority

### 1. Opening: Understanding Your Business Needs
You want communications that just work. Calls connect, lines stay up, costs are predictable and changes do not derail your day. You are not chasing the newest thing. You want clear value with minimal disruption, delivered through partners who know how to implement cleanly.

### 2. Buyer Pain: Cost and Productivity Concerns
Budgets are tight and workloads are up. Our latest buyer survey shows 45% list improving efficiency as a top priority and 44% say cost pressure is the biggest challenge. Teams are juggling multiple suppliers and plans. Service tickets bounce between vendors. Tool sprawl and overlapping contracts waste time. Underperformance shows up as slow fixes, dropped calls and missed SLAs, which 32% now cite as a blocker to progress. The result is avoidable rework and hidden cost.

### 3. Buyer Desire: Aligning with Business Goals
You want a dependable telecoms estate that is easy to manage and cheaper to run. That usually means:
* Fewer suppliers and clearer accountability
* Simple plans for mobiles and fixed lines with usage alerts
* Better visibility on outages, quality and spend
* Straight paths to upgrade or scale without penalties
* Support that resolves issues first time, not after a long back and forth
The aim is not a big transformation. It is a smoother operation with lower total cost and better service levels.

### 4. Example Illustration: From Problem to Solution
A regional services firm had mobiles, fixed lines and conferencing spread across four contracts. Staff complained about poor call quality and bill shock. We consolidated services to two contracts, aligned renewal dates and introduced simple reporting on usage and incidents. We also added a standard move add change process so the ops team could request changes in minutes.
Within the first quarter:
* Monthly spend dropped by 17% after removing unused lines and right sizing plans
* Mean time to resolve line faults improved by 29%
* Ticket volume fell as common issues were fixed at source
* Finance gained a single report for forecasting and cost control
No new platforms were required. The change was in the setup, supplier accountability and ongoing housekeeping.

### 5. Handling Objections
“We cannot risk downtime.”
Agreed. We plan migrations in maintenance windows and build fallbacks. You get a clear runbook and a go or no go checkpoint.
“We have no capacity to manage a project.”
We take the admin load. Your team validates key decisions only. Updates are short and scheduled.
“Will this lock us into long contracts?”
No. We prioritise flexible terms with clear exit points. Where long terms exist, we negotiate benefits you can measure.

### 6. Call to Action: Next Steps
Let us run a light touch telecoms review. We will map contracts, usage, incidents and renewal dates, then identify quick wins on cost and reliability. You get a short plan with actions, savings and risk notes. If the plan makes sense, we implement with minimal disruption and clear checkpoints. Would next Wednesday or Thursday suit for a 30 minute review?
