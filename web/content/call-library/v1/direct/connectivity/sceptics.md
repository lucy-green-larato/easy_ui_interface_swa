# Mobile and Fixed Connectivity: Sceptics
### 1. Opening: Understanding Your Business Needs
You are not here for a sales pitch. You are here because the network is quietly costing you time and money, and no one has quite solved it. SIMs go missing, fixed lines take weeks to move, and suppliers are slow to respond when things go wrong. You do not want a transformation project. You want telecoms to stop being a problem.
### 2. Buyer Pain: Cost and Productivity Concerns
In most organisations, mobile and fixed services have grown over time without much coordination. The result:
Long-term contracts that no longer match actual use
Site-level procurement with no central oversight
Inconsistent service quality across regions
Usage spikes that blow through budgets with no warning
When things go wrong, support teams escalate internally instead of solving the issue. IT ends up firefighting. Finance ends up guessing. Meanwhile, productivity suffers. Forty-three per cent of UK buyers say cost pressures are already holding back progress. And the network, while mostly invisible, quietly becomes a barrier.
### 3. Buyer Desire: Aligning with Business Goals
You are not asking for a revolution. You want visibility, control and peace of mind. That typically looks like:
One place to see and manage every mobile and fixed asset
Alerts that flag waste or downtime before it hits the bottom line
SLAs you can actually track and enforce
A support model that acts instead of escalating
This is not about adopting the latest platform. It is about knowing what you have, what it is costing and how to fix it if something breaks.
### 4. Example Illustration: From Problem to Solution
A regional services business had 40 sites and a fleet of 200 mobile users. Fixed contracts were managed by local teams. Mobile was on three different providers with no pooled usage. Support requests were routed through a generic helpdesk with five-day turnaround times. The ops director had no clean data, and frontline staff were raising tickets just to get moved to the right department.
We introduced a consolidated management view, migrated mobile to a pooled usage model and replaced the reactive helpdesk with a named support contact and ticket SLAs.
In the first quarter:
Support resolution times dropped by 63 per cent
Mobile overspend reduced by 29 per cent
New sites were brought online in under 10 days
IT regained 12 hours a week by removing duplicate escalations
The business got quieter. In a good way.
### 5. Handling Objections
“We’ve had bad experiences trying to switch providers.”
You do not need to switch. We work with your existing contracts and infrastructure. There is no pressure to replace anything unless it adds value.
“Our setup is too fragmented to sort easily.”
That is exactly why we start small. We focus on the messiest two or three locations, fix those, then repeat what works.
“We do not have capacity to take this on.”
You do not have to. We provide the resource, manage the onboarding and run it for you until it proves itself.
### 6. Call to Action: Next Steps
Let’s book a 45-minute Telecoms Clean-up Call. You will get:
A full map of mobile and fixed services with red flag spend areas
A simple fix list for the worst offenders
A roadmap that lets you improve one step at a time, at your pace
I will also send our “Connectivity Clean-up Toolkit”, with supplier scorecards, contract health checklists and onboarding templates. Would Tuesday morning or Friday afternoon work better for your team?
