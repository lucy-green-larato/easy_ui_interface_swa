# Opener
You’re scaling fast and need connectivity that keeps up. The goal is control and speed without adding admin—so mobile and fixed services should be simple to manage, transparent in cost and easy to adapt as teams and sites change.

# Context bridge
Most growing teams hit familiar bumps:
- Ad-hoc SIMs with no central oversight  
- Long contracts on fixed lines  
- Provisioning backlogs that slow roll-outs  
- Multiple suppliers with clashing SLAs

# Exploration nudge
So we can tailor the pilot, where do you feel the friction most—mobile data visibility, new-site turn-up speed, or contract lock-in?

# Objections
“We already have contracts.” → We work with your current estate and phase improvements at renewal—nothing wasted.  
“This sounds like an overhaul.” → It’s a light orchestration layer on top; keep what works, replace only what doesn’t.

Thanks for your time. I’ll follow up with a short summary and the pilot outline.
