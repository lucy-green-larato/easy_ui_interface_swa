# Mobile and Fixed Connectivity: Innovators
### 1. Opening: Understanding Your Business Needs
You are not buying mobile or fixed lines. You are investing in programmable infrastructure that lets your business seize opportunities before your competitors do. When your go-to-market team greenlights a campaign, or a site needs spinning up overnight, your network cannot be the bottleneck. It needs to flex instantly, deliver real-time data, and prove every pound spent is fuelling growth. That takes converged, controllable connectivity, not a jumble of SIMs, circuits and contracts.
### 2. Buyer Pain: Cost and Productivity Concerns
Most high-growth firms are constrained by yesterday’s connectivity:
Static lines that take 45+ days to provision or change
Mobile plans that throttle when usage spikes
Multiple suppliers with no unified view of costs or performance Tool sprawl is increasingly cited as a blocker.
Zero visibility into which sites or users are draining resource
Forty-three per cent of UK tech buyers say rising costs are already squeezing initiatives. 32% cite underperforming infrastructure as a blocker to growth. And when support tickets pile up or rollout delays hit revenue, the network becomes a liability.
### 3. Buyer Desire: Aligning with Business Goals
Innovators want infrastructure that behaves like software: scalable, observable and responsive to change. The wishlist looks like this:
A single orchestration layer across fixed and mobile services
Usage-based billing that lets Finance model cost by region or BU
Zero-touch provisioning with API access for ops or dev teams
Built-in failover and telemetry that IT trusts without second guessing
When mobile and fixed connectivity become programmable assets, every department can launch, test and adapt faster.
### 4. Example Illustration: From Problem to Solution
A healthcare SaaS provider was expanding across three countries and trialling an edge data product with wearable devices. Their network was stitched together with six contracts, unmanaged SIMs and a mix of leased lines with 90-day provisioning windows. The ops lead was logging 12+ hours a week chasing availability, usage stats and SLAs.
We replaced the patchwork with a converged SD-WAN overlay, centralised SIM pool and elastic bandwidth that scaled per site demand.
Results in the first quarter:
Site activation time dropped from 19 days to under 6
Data costs fell 31 per cent due to pooled policies and real-time throttling
Helpdesk tickets reduced by 46 per cent
The CTO could now map usage to product launches and investor reports
Connectivity became a launchpad, not a limiter.
### 5. Handling Objections
“We’ve already got contracts in place.”
That’s no problem. We layer orchestration and visibility on top, then phase improvements as renewals come up. No forced migrations.
“This sounds like a major project.”
It isn’t. We start with two locations or departments, show live impact, then scale. You stay in control the whole time.
“Our requirements are quite specific.”
Which is exactly why a modular, software-defined approach works. Everything is tailored to your operating model, not forced to fit a template.
### 6. Call to Action: Next Steps
Let’s book a 45-minute Connectivity Design Workshop with your IT and ops leads. You’ll get:
A performance map of your current mobile and fixed setup
A modular pilot plan with clear KPIs and cost control built in
Visibility on hidden risks, duplication or latency drag
I’ll also send our “Connectivity Modernisation Toolkit”, including readiness checklists, rollout timelines and benchmarking data to help you build the internal case. Would Tuesday morning or Thursday afternoon suit your team?
