## Opening
Your business depends on reliable, cost-effective connectivity. But managing mobile and fixed services across multiple sites and teams is becoming more complex. You need a setup that just works, without requiring constant admin or firefighting. The goal is not transformation for its own sake — it’s smoother operations, clearer visibility and fewer headaches.

## Buyer Pain
Most businesses reach a point where their existing telecoms setup starts to bite:
•	Mobile usage is unpredictable and hard to forecast
•	Fixed-line services are stuck in long contracts that no longer fit
•	SLAs are missed and support is reactive
•	No one has a full picture of what’s used, needed or wasted
Forty-three per cent of UK buyers say rising costs are already impacting plans. Thirty-two per cent say poor infrastructure is slowing them down. Even when things work on paper, the day-to-day effort to manage suppliers, changes and faults takes its toll.

## Buyer Desire
You want infrastructure that supports growth without creating extra overhead. That usually includes:
•	A single view of your mobile and fixed estate across all locations
•	Alerts and usage controls to prevent overages before they happen
•	A support model that prioritises response, not red tape
•	Flexibility to scale bandwidth or shift SIMs without chasing paperwork
It’s not about the latest tech. It’s about having confidence in the basics, knowing the right service is in place and working when needed.

## Example Illustration
One national retailer was managing fixed and mobile services across 70 sites. Each site had negotiated its own contracts, and mobile usage was being expensed rather than tracked centrally. When a POS upgrade required connectivity changes, the IT team had no clear view of what was installed where.
We introduced a centralised estate view with pooled mobile data, flexible broadband provisioning and a support team who managed moves, adds and changes as a service.
In the first six months:
•	Connectivity incidents dropped by 52 per cent
•	Mobile overspend was cut by 34 per cent
•	New store setup time dropped from 21 days to under 8
•	Finance could reconcile costs against usage for the first time
The IT manager described it as “getting the lights turned back on”.

## Handling Objections
“We’ve got contracts we can’t get out of.”
We work with what’s in place and apply governance over the top. When renewals roll around, you’ll already have a better model to move toward.
“We don’t have time for a big project.”
That’s fine. We start small — usually with two to five sites — and get results within a single billing cycle. It’s low risk, high impact.
“This won’t fit our setup.”
We customise everything around your business. Whether you have legacy tech or regional variations, we build a model that flexes with you.
