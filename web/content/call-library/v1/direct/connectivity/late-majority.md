# Mobile and Fixed Connectivity: Late Majority

### 1. Opening: Understanding Your Business Needs
Your priority is reliable connectivity for staff and sites without adding complexity. You want stable internet, sensible mobile plans and a support path that works. No experiments. Just a practical setup that cuts waste and keeps people online.

### 2. Buyer Pain: Cost and Productivity Concerns
Costs are under pressure while demand for bandwidth and mobility grows. In our latest survey, 45% say efficiency gains are a priority and 44% list cost pressure as the top challenge. Teams waste time chasing outages across multiple ISPs and mobile providers. Tool sprawl leads to overlapping tariffs and unmanaged extras. Underperformance shows up as slow links, congestion at peak times and dead zones for field staff. 32% report performance gaps as a blocker to progress.

### 3. Buyer Desire: Aligning with Business Goals
You want simple control of lines, circuits and plans, with clear performance and fewer surprises. Typically that means:
* Right sized broadband or leased line capacity per site
* Mobile plans aligned to real usage with alerts and caps
* A small number of providers with direct escalation paths
* Clear visibility of uptime, latency and data usage
* Standard processes for adds, moves and device replacements
The outcome is fewer incidents, faster fixes and better value from existing spend.

### 4. Example Illustration: From Problem to Solution
A multi site distributor ran mixed FTTC, FTTP and 4G backups across three providers. Field teams had mismatched mobile plans and roaming costs were unpredictable. We standardised line capacity by site profile, moved to a single core provider with 4G and 5G failover, and set pooled mobile data with real time alerts. We also put a simple incident playbook in place.
After two months:
* Site uptime increased with automatic failover removing most short outages
* Mobile bill variance reduced by 22% through pooled data and caps
* Mean time to restore connectivity improved by 35%
* Ops time spent on telco admin dropped meaningfully due to clearer processes
No new tools were needed for users. The improvements came from consolidation, right sizing and basic controls.

### 5. Handling Objections
“We cannot change lines during peak trading.”
We schedule changes outside peak and use temporary circuits where needed. You approve every step.
“Our users will resist any change.”
Most changes are invisible. Where devices are replaced, we plan short swap windows with pre tested setup.
“What about future growth?”
Capacity plans include headroom. Where sites expand, upgrades follow a known path and price.

### 6. Call to Action: Next Steps
We can run a short connectivity audit across your sites and mobiles. You will get a clear view of capacity, costs and risks, plus a plan for quick wins on stability and spend. If the plan stacks up, we deliver the changes with minimal disruption. Would you like a 30 minute review next week?
