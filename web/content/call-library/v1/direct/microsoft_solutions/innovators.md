# Microsoft Solutions: Innovators
### 1. Opening: Understanding Your Business Needs
You are not buying software. You are enabling collaboration, speed and scale. Microsoft tools sit at the heart of most businesses, but not all deployments are equal. Innovators want to move fast, ship early and pivot when needed. Your Microsoft stack should help, not hinder.
We work with fast-moving product and tech firms where IT teams need to build secure, scalable environments without slowing innovation. Microsoft has the breadth to power every part of the business, from DevOps to sales. The question is how to configure it for maximum impact.
### 2. Buyer Pain: Cost and Productivity Concerns
Too many growth firms treat Microsoft 365 as a fixed shelf of tools. Word, Excel, Outlook ,  nothing changed since 2012. Meanwhile, developers are off using unauthorised apps, finance builds dashboards in siloed spreadsheets, and security gaps widen with every new hire.
According to our 2025 buyer survey, 47 per cent of tech firms say they are underutilising their Microsoft licences. Worse still, 38 per cent have had to purchase add-on tools that duplicate functionality they already pay for inside the Microsoft ecosystem.
Misalignment costs more than money. It creates delays, friction between departments and wasted time spent chasing basic information.
### 3. Buyer Desire: Aligning with Business Goals
You want to drive value from what you already own. That means:
Automating workflows using Power Automate to reduce manual admin
Unlocking self-serve analytics in Power BI, rather than siloed Excel sheets
Using Teams as a true operational hub, not just a chat tool
Tightening security through Azure AD, conditional access and device policies
Giving product teams access to low-code tools without losing governance
The goal is to remove blockers without creating more platforms. Your Microsoft environment becomes a growth engine, not a cost centre.
### 4. Example Illustration: From Problem to Solution
We worked with a data-led marketing agency. They had M365 licences across the business but used less than 20 per cent of the available features. Teams was used for messaging only. Files lived across SharePoint, local drives and old Dropbox accounts.
Every campaign required rework. Briefs got lost. Time tracking was manual. Worst of all, each department had its own workflow tools, with no integration.
We started with a usage audit and found several quick wins:
Power Automate flows replaced six manual processes, including onboarding and client sign-off
SharePoint was restructured to reflect actual project stages
Teams channels became shared workspaces with linked dashboards and planning boards
Finance used Power BI to automate weekly reporting and flag late invoices
The result: Campaign delivery time dropped by 23 per cent. Staff satisfaction improved. The business cancelled three external tools and cut licence costs by 17 per cent within three months.
### 5. Handling Objections
“We already have Microsoft 365.”
That is a great start. We focus on configuring what you already pay for to deliver more value and remove blockers.
“Our teams prefer other tools.”
No problem. We do not force-fit Microsoft if the alternatives are better. But often, the performance gap disappears once M365 is properly set up.
“This sounds like a big project.”
We start small. A 30-minute audit highlights key opportunities. From there, we suggest phased improvements with fast payback.
### 6. Call to Action: Next Steps
Let us run a fast Microsoft Usage Audit. We will identify where features are underused, duplicated or causing friction. You will get a clear report showing potential savings, automation wins and a roadmap for better collaboration.
Would you like me to send a sample audit report and case study pack before we book a session?
