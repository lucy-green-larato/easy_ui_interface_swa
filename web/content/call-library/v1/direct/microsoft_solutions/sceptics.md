# Microsoft Solutions: Sceptics
### 1. Opening: Understanding Your Business Needs
You’ve made things work without chasing every new piece of software. You value stability, not experiments. But lately, something has shifted. Maybe a key customer asked for a new format. Maybe your finance team is stuck pulling together numbers from five places. Or maybe your team simply can’t access the files they need when working remotely.
You’re not alone. Many businesses in your position already have Microsoft licences, but they are not getting the value. Worse, the tools are sometimes making things more complicated, not less.
The good news? You do not need a tech overhaul. You just need to get the setup right.
### 2. Buyer Pain: Cost and Productivity Concerns
We see a clear pattern. Companies pay for Microsoft 365, but don’t use half the tools. Files are saved in odd places. Teams is used for chat, but not for sharing or task tracking. Staff revert to their old ways because the new ones feel confusing.
Our 2025 survey found that 43 per cent of businesses under 250 employees didn’t know which Microsoft tools were being used or whether they were delivering value. That’s a lot of spend with little return.
Worse still, when the setup isn’t working, it creates more admin, more manual work, and more delays. Which makes the whole thing feel like a waste of time.
### 3. Buyer Desire: Aligning with Business Goals
You want something that works. That your team can use without needing to call IT every five minutes. That actually helps, rather than slows them down. That is what we focus on.
We help firms like yours by:
Making shared folders easy to find and use
Setting up Teams to support real work, not just chat
Automating simple admin like time off requests or onboarding
Making sure you’re not paying for features no one uses
Showing staff how to get value from tools without jargon
It’s not about shiny tech. It’s about helping people do their jobs faster, with fewer headaches.
### 4. Example Illustration: From Problem to Solution
We worked with a regional wholesaler whose operations team was overwhelmed by customer queries. Most were routine, such as stock checks, delivery updates and basic FAQs, but staff were tied up answering them manually.
They already had Microsoft 365, but were using it only for email and shared calendars.
We helped them:
Create shared folders for product data
Build a Teams channel that allowed internal tracking of live orders
Set up a Power Automate flow to send order updates automatically from Excel
In the first month, customer queries dropped by 30 per cent and internal email volume fell significantly. No new software. Just better use of what they already had.
### 5. Handling Objections
“We already have Microsoft. Why would we pay someone to look at it?”
Because if it’s not set up properly, it is wasting time and money. We help you fix that and get the value you are already paying for.
“This sounds like a big project.”
It’s not. We start with a simple review and identify fast wins. No big rollout. No disruption.
“We don’t have IT people to manage this.”
You don’t need them. We do the work and make sure what we deliver is easy to manage.
### 6. Call to Action: Next Steps
Let’s book a short Microsoft Value Check. It takes 30 minutes and will show you where tools are underused, where staff are getting stuck, and how small changes could reduce effort across the board.
