# Microsoft Solutions: Early Majority
### 1. Opening: Understanding Your Business Needs
Your business is already up and running with Microsoft 365. You’ve done the rollout, got the licences in place and your teams are using the tools. But now you are asking a sensible question: are we getting the full value?
Most early majority firms are not looking to reinvent the wheel. You want practical improvements that help your teams collaborate better, reduce wasted time and ensure the tools you already pay for are used properly.
The good news is that Microsoft 365 is full of capability. Often, it just takes a structured review and some simple changes to unlock it.
### 2. Buyer Pain: Cost and Productivity Concerns
You are not alone in feeling unsure about Microsoft return on investment. Our 2025 buyer survey found that 43 per cent of respondents could not say how well the tools were being used. That means lost value and missed opportunities.
We also see common friction points:
Files stored in too many places
Teams channels set up inconsistently
Manual admin that could be automated
Low awareness of built-in features like Planner, To Do or Power BI
This leads to staff frustration, duplicated effort and poor visibility across departments. You are not failing to use the system. It just hasn’t been fine-tuned to match how your business actually works.
### 3. Buyer Desire: Aligning with Business Goals
You want Microsoft tools that support your business goals. That means better visibility, less duplication and smarter use of what you already have. Common requests include:
Clearer folder structures and access policies
Using Teams for project management, not just chat
Automating routine tasks like leave requests or expense tracking
Consolidating reporting using Power BI dashboards
Improving onboarding with templated processes in SharePoint
These are not big, disruptive changes. They are small improvements that make everyday work smoother and more productive.
### 4. Example Illustration: From Problem to Solution
A growing logistics firm came to us after their internal teams raised concerns about confusion in file storage, inconsistent Teams use and delays in generating monthly KPIs.
They were not misusing Microsoft. They just had no internal process for setting it up in a joined-up way. We carried out a usage review and worked with their operations lead to deliver fast wins:
Project templates were added to Teams, including task lists, contacts and linked files
SharePoint was cleaned up and structured by department, reducing search times
A Power BI dashboard was configured to pull key KPIs automatically from Excel sheets
Within four weeks, reporting delays were cut by 60 per cent, internal emails dropped, and staff described the new setup as “cleaner and easier to follow”. No new tools were introduced, and no consultants were required after handover.
### 5. Handling Objections
“We already use Microsoft. We’re not looking to change platform.”
Perfect. This is not about switching tools. It is about getting full value from what you already own.
“Our staff are already stretched. We can’t take on a big project.”
You don’t need to. We prioritise changes that save time quickly and can often make improvements without disrupting your teams.
“We don’t have IT resources to manage this.”
That’s fine. We do the review and provide simple steps your teams can follow. Most fixes do not require technical skills.
### 6. Call to Action: Next Steps
Let’s run a 45-minute Microsoft Productivity Review. We will look at how your tools are currently set up, where the friction points are, and what small improvements would unlock more value.
I can also send our Microsoft 365 Usage Checklist, which highlights the top five underused features and how to apply them in a growing business.
