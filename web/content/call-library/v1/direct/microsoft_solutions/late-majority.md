# Microsoft Solutions: Late Majority
### 1. Opening: Understanding Your Business Needs
You are not looking for the latest flashy tools. You are looking for reliability, ease and better control. Microsoft 365 is already in place across much of your business, but it might not be set up to work the way you need it to.
Late majority buyers often tell us the same thing. The licences are there. The software is familiar. But people are still saving files in the wrong place, emailing versions back and forth, and using five steps to do something that should take one.
We believe that better doesn’t have to mean harder. With small changes and the right support, Microsoft tools can quietly improve how your teams work, without needing new systems or long training sessions.
### 2. Buyer Pain: Cost and Productivity Concerns
When Microsoft 365 isn’t set up properly, it can create as many problems as it solves. People struggle to find the latest version of a document. Different departments use different systems for storing files. Staff duplicate work without realising.
Licences also go to waste. Our 2025 buyer survey found that 43 per cent of firms with under 250 employees were unsure which Microsoft features they were using or whether they were getting value from their spend.
The real cost is time. Time wasted looking for information. Time spent manually copying and pasting data. Time lost chasing the wrong version of a file.
### 3. Buyer Desire: Aligning with Business Goals
You want to get more from the tools you already have. That might mean:
Saving time by using shared folders and co-authoring features
Setting up Teams properly so people can collaborate without needing to email
Using OneDrive instead of local drives that create risk and confusion
Adding in simple automations that reduce admin without needing coding skills
Getting help to understand what you are paying for and how to make the most of it
These are not big changes. They are quick wins that can improve productivity, reduce stress and make life easier for your teams.
### 4. Example Illustration: From Problem to Solution
We recently helped a regional recruitment agency with 40 staff. They were using Microsoft 365 for email and calendars but still saved files to desktop folders. Teams had been set up, but most people preferred to call or email because they didn’t know how to use it properly.
We ran a usage review and delivered three small improvements:
Shared folders were set up for each department, with clear access rules
Teams channels were structured to reflect client and job flow, making it easier to collaborate
A simple Power Automate flow was introduced to notify finance when a new placement was confirmed
The changes took less than two weeks to implement. Within one month, internal emails dropped by 15 per cent and time spent locating files fell sharply. Staff said the new setup “just made more sense”.
### 5. Handling Objections
“We’re already using Microsoft. We don’t need new tools.”
We are not suggesting new tools. We help you get more from what you already pay for.
“It feels like too much change.”
We agree. That is why we focus on small, easy fixes that support your existing ways of working.
“We don’t have the IT expertise.”
You do not need it. We do the setup and training for you. Everything is designed to be easy to manage after we leave.
