# IT Solutions: Early Majority
### 1. Opening: Understanding Your Business Needs
You’ve invested steadily in your IT setup. You’ve got a mix of internal tools, outsourced services and maybe a few older systems that still get the job done. But cracks are starting to show.
Maybe your support team is overloaded. Maybe your finance team is questioning why IT spend keeps rising without a clear link to business performance. Or maybe your staff are grumbling about slow fixes and too many logins.
We work with businesses in exactly this position, trying to modernise IT without risking disruption or spiralling costs.
### 2. Buyer Pain: Cost and Productivity Concerns
For many early majority firms, IT starts to feel like a necessary burden. Systems work, but they’re clunky. Tickets get resolved, but slowly. People rely on workarounds and shadow tools.
Your IT lead is probably stretched thin, juggling procurement, user support, security and onboarding. Meanwhile, other departments are requesting new tools or services that your current stack cannot easily deliver.
In a 2025 survey, 33 per cent of businesses named “poor integration between systems” as a key blocker. Another 38 per cent struggled to keep up with vendor sprawl and rising licence costs.
The risk is clear: productivity dips and small IT issues become business problems.
### 3. Buyer Desire: Aligning with Business Goals
What you want is control. Stability. Support you can trust. Systems that work without daily firefighting.
That means IT services that:
Fit your current setup and scale with you
Offer predictable costs and clear SLAs
Reduce support load without adding complexity
Help you modernise at your pace, without forced overhauls
We help early majority firms take stock, simplify what they have and plan sensible improvements. No jargon. No unnecessary change. Just clear steps to make IT work better for everyone.
### 4. Example Illustration: From Problem to Solution
We supported a logistics company with 90 employees across three UK sites. They were using a mix of ageing desktops, outsourced support for servers and a cloud email service that no one fully managed.
Staff were raising repeat tickets. Devices were slow. Nobody knew who owned what licences. And when a key system went down, it took days to restore full access.
We ran a short discovery and proposed a staged improvement plan. First, we introduced a remote monitoring tool to get visibility on device health. Then we added a user support model with a 4-hour response SLA. We also helped consolidate their licence estate across Microsoft, antivirus and backup.
Within three months:
Ticket volume dropped 35 per cent
Response times improved by 50 per cent
Software spend was reduced by 20 per cent
Staff reported fewer issues and less downtime
### 5. Handling Objections
“We don’t want a big IT project.”
You don’t need one. We focus on small wins that make a big difference. Most clients start with a specific pain point and expand from there.
“We’re not ready to replace what we have.”
Good. Neither are we. We work with your existing systems where they add value and recommend changes only where it makes sense.
“We’re not very technical.”
That’s fine. We keep things simple. We explain options clearly and support you throughout. You stay in control at every stage.
### 6. Call to Action: Next Steps
Let’s arrange a 45-minute working session with your IT lead and operations manager. We’ll look at what’s working, where the stress points are and where you could save time or money without major upheaval.
I’ll also send over our “IT Made Simple” guide. It includes case studies and a self-assessment checklist to help you benchmark your current IT setup.
