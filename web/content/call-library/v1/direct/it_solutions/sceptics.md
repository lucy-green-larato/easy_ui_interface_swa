# IT Solutions: Sceptics
### 1. Opening: Understanding Your Business Needs
Not every business needs a full IT department. Many of the most efficient small firms we work with use the same setup they have had for years, with a handful of trusted tools, solid processes and minimal disruption.
But pressure is growing to show that your technology is up to scratch. Customers expect faster responses. Insurers want better risk controls. Your own team may also be quietly frustrated with the workarounds they rely on to get things done.
We are not here to sell transformation. We are here to help you keep things running smoothly, while reducing hassle and risk.
### 2. Buyer Pain: Cost and Productivity Concerns
Many sceptics tell us the same thing: “It works, so why change it?” And they are right ,  until it doesn’t.
Older systems create hidden costs. Staff lose time waiting for slow machines or dealing with printing issues. Backup drives get forgotten. Passwords get reused. When something breaks, there may be no one on hand to fix it quickly.
You might also be paying for licences or services that nobody uses anymore. That is money down the drain.
In a 2025 survey, over 40 per cent of small business owners said they had little confidence in the accuracy of their IT spend.
### 3. Buyer Desire: Aligning with Business Goals
You want things to work. You want to keep costs under control. And you want to avoid nasty surprises, like a system crash, cyber incident or sudden compliance demand.
That is exactly what we help with. We offer simple, low-maintenance services that:
Keep your current setup working smoothly
Replace only what is outdated or risky
Provide reliable support when needed
Give you visibility into what you are spending and why
It is similar to servicing a reliable van. It gets the job done, but still needs the occasional check-up to avoid breakdowns.
### 4. Example Illustration: From Problem to Solution
We worked with a regional wholesaler whose operations team was overwhelmed by customer queries. Most were routine, like stock checks, delivery updates or basic FAQs. Staff were tied up answering them manually.
Their systems were not broken. They were just behind the times.
We recommended three small changes:
Set up a shared inbox with automated replies for common questions
Install a basic CRM to track orders and queries
Provide a single point of contact for IT issues, with guaranteed response times
The result:
Customer queries dropped by 25 per cent
Orders were fulfilled faster because staff were less distracted
The team felt more confident using the tools they already had
### 5. Handling Objections
“We’re not tech people.”
You don’t have to be. We keep things simple and explain everything clearly. You stay in control.
“We’re too small for this.”
Small businesses are often hit hardest when systems fail. A little support goes a long way, and we tailor everything to your size and budget.
We don’t want change.”
We understand. That is why we focus on improvements, not overhauls. You keep what works and improve what doesn’t.
### 6. Call to Action: Next Steps
Let’s arrange a short call. We will review your current setup, flag any obvious risks and suggest a few low-cost improvements.
I can also send our “Sensible IT” checklist. It is a one-page guide to keeping systems running, reducing risk and getting the best out of what you already have.
Does Thursday morning work for a quick chat?
