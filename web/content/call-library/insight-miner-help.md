## What Insight Miner does
Reads public filings on Companies House and scans each company’s *Strategic Report* for your keyword/phrase. You get evidence-based matches, snippets, and a downloadable CSV.

## When to use it
- To evidence real activity (e.g., “West Midlands expansion”, “AI investment”, “sustainability”).
- To prioritise which accounts to work now vs. later.
- To brief sales with concrete, cited language from directors.

## How to run a quick search
- Pick a **specific keyword** (e.g., “west midlands”, “cloud migration”, “cybersecurity”).
- Upload a CSV with **Company Name** and **Company Number**.
- Click **Start small run** (≤ 50 companies).
- Watch the **live summary** and snippets; download results when done.

## Good keywords (examples)
- Regional: *west midlands*, *manchester*, *scotland*
- Change programmes: *digital transformation*, *cloud migration*
- Capability: *ai*, *machine learning*, *cybersecurity*, *iot*
- ESG: *sustainability*, *net zero*, *renewables*

## Interpreting matches
A match means your phrase appears in a meaningful context in the Strategic Report. Read the snippet to judge intent, timing, and strength of signal.

## Turning signals into action
- **Territory planning:** cluster matches by region to target local campaigns.
- **Messaging:** reuse the directors’ language in your outreach.
- **Account selection:** prioritise companies with recent, concrete statements.
- **Quarterly review:** re-run the same query each quarter to track momentum.

## Tips for better signals
- Avoid generic words (e.g., *growth*). Prefer **two-word phrases**.
- If you get zero results, try a **near synonym** or broaden one step.
- Keep lists small for rapid iteration; scale only when the phrase performs.

## Privacy & storage
- Your upload is processed server-side and turned into three files: results, log, CSV.
- Only evidence from public filings is used; private inputs aren’t shared.

## Need help?
- If the progress bar stalls, refresh after a few seconds.
- If upload fails, ensure headers are exactly **Company Name** and **Company Number**.
